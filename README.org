[[./screenshot.jpg]]

** How to use

You can download the script to wherever you want, and

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'yqfk)
#+END_SRC

And you will have a new command at your fingertip! Use ~M-x yqfk-submit<RET>~ to
save 2 extra seconds every day!

You can also bind it to a hotkey, if you want:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "s-;") 'yqfk-submit)
#+END_SRC

Or to whatever key you wish.
